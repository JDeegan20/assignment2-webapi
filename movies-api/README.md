## API Design
Give an overview of your web API design, perhaps similar to the following: 

- /api/movies | GET | Gets a list of movies 
- /api/movies/{movieid}/reviews | GET | Get all reviews for movie 
- /api/upcoming | GET | Gets a list of upcoming movies 
- /api/popular | GET | Gets a list of popular movies
- /api/nowplaying | GET | Gets a list of movies that are now playing in cinema
- /api/toprated | GET | Gets a list of toprated movies

## PLEASE NOTE
Apologies my app is not working Im having trouble with my AuthContext but couldn't figure out what was wrong. I put in as much things as I could into this assignment but I always seemed to get errors. Im not sure if I integrated my API properly
